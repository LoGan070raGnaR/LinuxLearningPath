# Chapter 2: Linux Philosophy and Concepts

## Preparing Your Computer for Linux

### Introduction

In the early days of Linux, installation was a back-breaking process, involving downloading dozens of floppy disks (through slow telephone lines) and loading them one by one. 

Eventually distributors developed CD-based installations which were far more user-friendly, and as the size of the installation gradually expanded DVD-based methods also became widespread. 

The early install programs presented one with many configurable choices, especially regarding: 

- **Desktop Manager**: (usually **GNOME** or **KDE**) which controls the look and feel of the desktop
- **Software Selection**: Unlike vendors of other operating systems, **Linux** distributors offer not just the basic operating system and utilities, but a wide range of applications and utilities. For other operating systems, the equivalents would have to be separately installed (after basic system installation) after downloading and/or purchase from a variety of sources. It is convenient that most **Linux** users can find all the software they will ever need provided freely in the distribution’s packaging system. 

Often the new **Linux** user didn’t possess the knowledge or experience to assess the parameters of these choices or their long-range repercussions. 

As a result most distributions now limit the number of choices that must be made during installation to a small number of basic questions; default answers are those most commonly useful. Typically no more than a few obvious questions must be answered during the install, which proceeds rather quickly. More detailed software selection can be made post-install through the use of various graphical package management systems.

### Section 1: Introduction

#### 1.1 Quick Guide 

Steps to install Linux: 

1. Decide which Linux distribution you want to use. (Later we will give a table of common choices and useful links for downloading install media, and helpful tutorials on procedure.) 
2. Download the install image, which will be either a local or network install image or a Live image (which can also be used for install.) 
3. Decide if you want to do a: 
	1. **Native Installation**: To do this you will need a machine with enough useable disk space or will have to repartition to make space available. 
	2. **Virtual Machine Installation**: To do this you’ll have to first install a hypervisor program. 
	3. **Live CD/DVB/USB method**: To do this no install is needed, but performance will be weaker. 
4. Do the install following distribution-supplied directions. 
5. Enjoy!

### Section 2: Linux Distribution Choices

The term **Linux** may mean different things to different people but in a narrow sense it refers only to the operating system **kernel**: the basic program that underlies everything else that communicates with the hardware (such as CPU, memory and attached devices) and the applications that run on the computer.

Everything else on your computer (including all the software needed to give you a nice graphical desktop) provides the full **operating system** to which many applications are added. When people use the loosely defined term **Linux System** they really should be saying **Linux-based System**.

It’s a lot of work to assemble all the other components that are stacked above the **Linux** kernel (applications, libraries, graphical environments etc) and it is the job of a **Linux Distribution** to integrate all these components in a clean and updatable entity that users can take advantage of.

There are many different Linux distributions (sometimes called distros).

- Red Hat: Including Fedora, Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), and CentOS.
- Debian: Including Debian, Ubuntu and Linux Mint.
- SUSE: Including SUSE and openSUSE.

We should note that there are many more distribution choices available;

http://lwn.net/Distributions has a very complete list. Some distributions really don’t fit into the above three families, but they are unlikely to be ones that new users to Linux gravitate towards. Thus we will work within these three families. 

Here is a table listing the main websites for the major distributions in the three abovementioned families. You can easily find download media using these links or at mirror sites mentioned there such as http://mirrors.kernel.org

| Distribution                | Location                                                                |

### Section 3: Installation Methods

All Linux distributions provide downloadable installation media in the form of optical media images (CD and/ or DVD) which can be easily burned to a physical disk, or USB stick images, together with instructions on how to produce a USB drive that can be booted from for installation.

These images vary in type of machine (e.g., 64-bit or 32-bit; we recommend doing only 64-bit installs on modern hardware that supports it) or small or large (e.g., minimal or full desktop or server system).

Alternatively, one can do a much smaller download and get a network install image which has just a few files; then the installation procedure goes out on the Internet to get whatever else is needed. Such a network install has only a short initial download, but the install process itself can take a long time based on your network download speed. A full install image may also support going out to the Internet during installation, like a network install, but only to retrieve software with a newer version available than was included in the full install image.

#### 3.1 Using Live Media Instead of a Full Install

Many popular distributions provide Live CD, DVD, or USB media which can be used to run Linux without actually installing it on your disk drives. As you can imagine, this is the safest method of experimenting with Linux if you already have a computer running another operating system.

There are disadvantages however:

- Slow startup: every time you boot up the hardware has to be examined and the operating system set up as if you were doing a fresh install.
- Performance can be poor, so more memory and CPU power may be required to make things run acceptably.
- It can be awkward to save any work or other material either on the normal hard disk or to external media etc, although it can be done. In particular, any changes in setup or any other software that is installed may be lost each time one boots up.

Please note that the Live media image and the Install image is the same for many modern user-friendly distributions! One simply boots off the Live image and then clicks on Install once the system starts. One very nice aspect of this dual-use media is that before you even attempt an install, you know whether or not the Linux-based operating system can recognize and work with all of your hardware and peripherals, such as your network card, sound system, webcam etc.

#### 3.2 Installing a Hypervisor and a Virtual Machine

Everyone has probably heard the phrase Virtual Machine. This is a full guest operating system (which may or may not be Linux) which runs on top of a Hypervisor program on a host machine, which can be running any operating system with an available hypervisor, including all flavors of Windows, Linux and Mac OS.

An advantage of using the virtual machine images is that you can’t fundamentally destroy your host system while running them, and they run as an unprivileged application, which may be more compatible with company IT policies, if applicable. A further advantage, especially with on-line classes, is that a system failure does not take you off-line.

The disadvantages have mostly to do with performance and requiring somewhat more memory and CPU power. However, in many circumstances this will not be a disqualifying aspect.

You will have to install a hypervisor program if you don’t already have one. Here are two easily obtainable low- or nocost solutions:

- **Oracle Virtual Box**
	- Can be downloaded from https://www.virtualbox.org 
	- Exists for Windows, Linux, Mac OS and Solaris operating systems
- **VMware**
	- Exists in full-featured products such as VMware Workstation but also in a freely downloadable version, VMware
	- Player which can be reached at http://www.vmware.com/try-vmware.html. While VMware Player is free of charge only for Windows and Linux host operating systems, VMware Fusion is a low cost program for the Mac OS.

Once you have installed the hypervisor, installing a guest operating system is pretty easy. You don’t even have to burn the install image to a **CD** or **DVD**; you can just point the hypervisor to the .iso image on your computer. In some cases (such as for **Virtual Box**) you can even perform an automatic installation which doesn’t even ask you questions when you install!

The rest of the discussion on installation for the most part applies here, except you won’t have to worry about the difficult things like partitioning; you can just take the default choices. However, make sure you assign enough disk space (say at least 20 GB to be safe, although you’ll probably need quite a bit less).

#### 3.3 Performing a Native Linux Installation

Virtually all popular Linux distributions have straightforward installation instructions these days, and most provide a live CD or USB stick which can also be used to do an install. One first boots off the Live media; a successful boot verifies that the Linux distribution is outof-the-box compatible with your hardware, and you can then click on install to place the Linux distribution on your hard disk. (Using **Wubi** to install Ubuntu from within Windows does not count as a native installation. Performance is worse than using a virtual machine as discussed above.)

In the simplest case you do a pure Linux installation, which involves wiping the hard disk and discarding whatever operating system was previously installed. Unless you are installing Linux on a machine you can completely dedicate for that purpose, it is likely that is not what you want; instead you want to set up a **multi-boot** configuration. This will present you a choice when the system starts between Linux, Windows or another operating system, or between different versions of Linux; e.g, you might have Ubuntu and Fedora separately installed on the same machine.

Multi-boot installations require you to be very careful when you install so pay attention to the parts where you are asked about your disk setup, to make sure you only use parts of your hard disk which are not already in use. If you are lucky, your install program can deal with your pre-existing format easily. However, if there is no available space that can be freshly partitioned, or partitions which can be erased and recycled, life can get complicated. This is what we discuss in the next section.

#### 3.4 Disk Space and Partitioning

In order to proceed with installation, you generally need enough available space on the hard disk. Furthermore, it has to be in either unallocated free space outside of any existing partition, or partitions must be available for reformatting.

This is non-trivial for most systems that have not already had multi-boot configurations set up before; this step (which must be taken care of first) can easily be more time-consuming than the actual installation. We have seen systems which took hours to prepare a suitable partioning setup, but once done, installation finished in about 20 minutes.

Most LiveCD/USB media contain system software to resize, move, create and delete disk partitions; utilizing a program called gparted. If you are lucky you can simply use gparted to shrink an already existing partition and free up 20-30 GB or so, then do your normal installation. Be careful during the procedure to properly answer any questions about your hard disk layout so you do not destroy existing, in-use partitions.

Many systems may already have four primary disk partitions in use; if this is the case you cannot create any new partitions. (You can have no more than four primary partitions, or up to three primary partitions plus an extended partition, in which you can create a number of logical partitions.) For example, some manufacturers set up two partitions reserved for Windows (a boot partition and the C: drive), one partition reserved for the recovery disk and one partition for manufacturer diagnostics. If you are stuck with this situation, you have to delete a partition to get your primaries down to three or do more complicated things, such as converting one of the primary partitions to a logical one, and you will still have to do some steps of shrinking and moving partitions.

The bottom line is that unless you feel comfor table messing with your partitioning setup, have the time to deal with any potential problems, and have an available lifeline if disaster strikes, you will probably be better off doing a virtual machine installation or using a Live media option.

## Linux History

### Linux History Overview

Linux is an open source computer operating system, initially developed on and for Intel x86-based personal computers. It has been subsequently ported to an astoundingly long list of other hardware platforms, from tiny embedded appliances to the world's largest supercomputers.

In this section, we follow the surprising history of how Linux evolved from a project of one Finnish college student, into a massive effort with an enormous impact on today's world.

### Linux History

Linus Torvalds was a student in Helsinki, Finland, in 1991, when he started a project: writing his own operating system **kernel**. He also collected together and/or developed the other essential ingredients required to construct an entire operating system with his kernel at the center. It wasn't long before this became known as the Linux kernel. 

In 1992, Linux was re-licensed using the **General Public License** (**GPL**) by **GNU** (a project of the Free Software Foundation or FSF, which promotes freely available software), which enabled it to build a worldwide community of developers. By combining the kernel with other system components from the GNU project, numerous other developers created complete systems called **Linux Distributions**, which first appeared in the mid-90s.

### More About Linux History

The Linux distributions created in the mid-90s provided the basis for fully free (in the sense of freedom, not zero cost) computing and became a driving force in the open source software movement. In 1998, major companies like IBM and Oracle announced their support for the Linux platform and began major development efforts as well.

Today, Linux powers more than half of the servers on the Internet, the majority of smartphones (via the Android system, which is built on top of Linux), more than 90 percent of the public cloud workload, and all of the world’s most powerful supercomputers.

### Linux Philosophy Overview

Every successful project or organization needs an implicit or explicit philosophy that frames its objectives and projects its growth path. This section contains a description of the philosophy adopted by the Linux community and how it has impacted Linux's amazing evolution.

---

![Logo](/resources/008.jpg "Logo")

Linux is constantly enhanced and maintained by a network of developers from all over the world collaborating over the Internet, with Linus Torvalds at the head. Technical skills, a desire to contribute, and the ability to collaborate with others are the only qualifications for participating.

### Linux Philosophy

Linux borrows heavily from the well-established family of UNIX operating systems. It was written to be a free and open source alternative; at the time, UNIX was designed for computers much more powerful than PCs, and furthermore, it was quite expensive.

Files are stored in a hierarchical filesystem, with the top node of the system being the **root** or simply "**/**". Whenever possible, Linux makes its components available via files or objects that look like files. Processes, devices, and network sockets are all represented by file-like objects and can often be worked with using the same utilities used for regular files. Linux is a fully multitasking (i.e., multiple threads of execution are performed simultaneously), multiuser operating system with built-in networking and service processes known as daemons in the UNIX world.

_**NOTE:** Linux was inspired by UNIX, but it is not UNIX._

## Linux Community

### Linux Community Overview

Suppose that, as part of your job, you need to configure a Linux file server, and you run into some difficulties. If you are not able to figure out the answer yourself or get help from a co-worker, the Linux community might just save the day!

---

![Logo](/resources/009.jpg "Logo")

There are many ways to engage with the Linux community, even if you are not a developer:

- Post queries on relevant discussion forums.
- Subscribe to discussion threads.
- Join local Linux groups that meet in your area.

### Linux Community

In August 1991, a 20-year-old computer science student embarked on a journey that would change the course of computing history. Linus Torvalds, seated at his computer in Helsinki, posted a now-iconic message announcing his project: "Hello everyone out there... I'm doing a free operating system (just a hobby, won't be anything big and professional like GNU)... it probably won't support anything other than AT-hard disks, as that's all I have..."

Word of Torvalds' open-source project, named Linux, quickly spread globally, attracting contributions from developers worldwide. Torvalds chose the GPL license, created by Richard Stallman, which granted users unprecedented freedoms: the ability to use, modify, and share the software freely.

This groundbreaking concept propelled Linux from a hobby to the foundation of a thriving commercial ecosystem. Companies like Red Hat capitalized on Linux's success, with its stock tripling upon going public in 1999. IBM invested heavily in Linux development, recognizing its potential.

Despite facing competitive challenges, Linux not only survived but thrived. Today, its kernel development community boasts thousands of contributors from hundreds of companies. New versions are released every three months.

Linux's impact is profound, running on 75% of stock exchanges worldwide and powering servers for tech giants like Amazon, Facebook, and Google. It's ubiquitous, present in smartphones, TVs, supercomputers, and everyday devices.

Linus Torvalds, the visionary behind Linux, coordinates this global developer community from his home office in Portland, Oregon.


### More About Linux Community

The Linux community is a far-reaching ecosystem consisting of developers, system administrators, users, and vendors who use many different forums to connect with one another. Among the most popular are:

- Internet Relay Chat (IRC) software (such as WeeChat, HexChat, Pidgin, and XChat)
	- Online communities and discussion boards including Linux User Groups (both local and online)
	- Many collaborative projects hosted on services such as GitHub and GitLab
	- Newsgroups and mailing lists, including the Linux Kernel Mailing List
	- Community events, e.g., Hackathons, Install Fests, Open Source Summits, Embedded Linux Conferences, and many other conferences and get-togethers.

A portal to one of the most powerful online user communities can be found at linux.com. This site is hosted by The Linux Foundation and serves over one million unique visitors every month. It has active sections on:

- News
	- Community discussion threads
	- Free tutorials and user tips.

### What OSS Products Do You Use?

Below are some examples of open source products that you probably encounter on a daily basis:

1. 1. 1. Android: used in the majority of smartphones and other mobile devices worldwide, built on top of the Linux kernel.
        2. Apache Web Server (httpd): about half of all web servers are running Apache and its related products.
        3. Social Media: virtually all social media platforms (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, etc.) use OSS components throughout.
        4. Search Engines: Google and other search engines have vast data farms running Linux.
        5. Weather Forecasting: essentially, 100% of the world’s supercomputers run Linux, and forecasting the weather is one of the most intensive uses.
        6. Personal Fitness Devices: including FitBit.
        7. DVRs: almost all set-top boxes and video recorders run Linux
        8. Medical Devices: a large number of medical devices used routinely every day are running Embedded Linux.

*All these projects make extensive use of OSS tooling, such as gcc, make, glibc, and languages such as Python, Perl, and Ruby.

## Linux Terminology

### Linux Terminology Overview

When you start exploring Linux, you will soon come across some terms which may be unfamiliar, such as distribution, boot loader, desktop environment, etc. Before we proceed further, let's stop and take a look at some basic terminology used in Linux to help you get up to speed.

---

![Logo](/resources/010.jpg "Logo")

---

### Linux Terminology

Before delving into Linux, it's essential to grasp some fundamental terms widely used within the Linux community:

1. **Kernel**:
   - The kernel serves as the core of the Linux operating system, controlling hardware interactions and facilitating application execution. The Linux kernel, available at kernel.org, exemplifies this crucial component.

2. **Distribution (Distros)**:
   - A distribution comprises a collection of programs combined with the Linux kernel to form a Linux-based operating system. Examples include Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Fedora, Ubuntu, and Gentoo.

3. **Boot Loader**:
   - The boot loader is a program responsible for initiating the operating system. Notable examples include GRUB and ISOLINUX.

4. **Service**:
   - Services are programs running in the background, facilitating various functions. Examples include httpd, nfsd, ntpd, ftpd, and named.

5. **Filesystem**:
   - Filesystems organize and store files within Linux. Examples encompass ext3, ext4, FAT, XFS, and Btrfs.

6. **X Window System**:
   - This system furnishes the standard toolkit and protocol to construct graphical user interfaces across Linux systems.

7. **Desktop Environment**:
   - The desktop environment provides a graphical user interface atop the operating system. GNOME, KDE, Xfce, and Fluxbox represent common examples.

8. **Command Line**:
   - The command line serves as an interface for inputting commands directly into the operating system.

9. **Shell**:
   - The shell acts as the command line interpreter, executing commands and tasks on the operating system's behalf. Popular shells include bash, tcsh, and zsh.

## Linux Distributions

### Linux Distributions Overview

If you are building a product designed to run on  Linux, project requirements will surely include making sure the project works properly on the most widely used Linux distributions. To accomplish this, you need to learn about the different components, services, and configurations associated with each distribution.

### Linux Distributions

So, what is a Linux distribution, and how does it relate to the Linux kernel?

The Linux kernel is the core of the operating system. A full Linux distribution consists of the kernel plus a number of other software tools for file-related operations, user management, and software package management. Each of these tools provides a part of the complete system. Each tool is often its own separate project, with its own developers working to perfect that piece of the system.

While the most recent Linux kernel (and earlier versions) can always be found in the [Linux Kernel Archives](https://www.kernel.org/), Linux distributions may be based on different kernel versions. For example, the very popular RHEL 8 distribution is based on the 4.18 kernel, which is not new, but is extremely stable, while the newer RHEL 9 distribution is based on the much later 5.14 kernel. Other distributions may move more quickly in adopting the latest kernel releases. It is important to note that the kernel is not an all-or-nothing proposition. For example, RHEL/CentOS has incorporated many of the more recent kernel improvements into their customized older versions, as have Ubuntu, openSUSE, Fedora, etc.

Examples of other essential tools and ingredients provided by distributions include the C/C++ and Clang compilers, the gdb debugger, the core system libraries applications need to link with in order to run, the low-level interface for drawing graphics on the screen, as well as the higher-level desktop environment, and the system for installing and updating the various components, including the kernel itself. And all distributions come with a rather complete suite of applications already installed.

### Services Associated with Distributions

The vast variety of Linux distributions are designed to cater to many different audiences and organizations according to their specific needs and tastes. However, large organizations, such as companies and governmental institutions, and other entities, tend to choose the major commercially-supported distributions from Red Hat, SUSE, and Canonical (Ubuntu).

CentOS and CentOS Stream are popular free (as in no cost) alternatives to Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) and are often used by organizations that are comfortable operating without paid technical support. Note that new versions of CentOS disappeared at the end of 2021 in favor of CentOS Stream. However,  at least two new RHEL-derived substitutes,   Alma Linux and Rocky Linux, have established a healthy foothold.

The RHEL variants, such as CentOS and AlmaLinux, are designed to be binary-compatible with RHEL; i.e., in most cases, binary software packages will install properly across the distributions.

Ubuntu and Fedora are widely used by developers and are also popular in the educational realm.  Many commercial distributors, including Red Hat, Ubuntu, SUSE, and Oracle, provide long-term fee-based support for their distributions, as well as hardware and software certification. All major distributors provide update services for keeping your system primed with the latest security and bug fixes and performance enhancements, as well as provide online support resources.
