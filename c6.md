# Chapter 6: Common Applications

## Internet Applications

### Internet Applications

The Internet is a global network that allows users around the world to perform multiple tasks, such as searching for data, communicating through emails and online shopping. Obviously, you need to use network-aware applications to take advantage of the Internet. These include:

- Web browsers
- Email clients
- Streaming media applications
- Internet Relay Chats
- Conferencing software

- Firefox
- Google Chrome
- Chromium
- Epiphany (renamed web)
- Konqueror
- linx, lynx, w3m
- Opera

### Email Applications

Email applications allow for sending, receiving, and reading messages over the Internet. Linux systems offer a wide number of email clients, both graphical and text-based. In addition, many users simply use their browsers to access their email accounts.

Most email clients use the Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) or the older Post Office Protocol (POP) to access emails stored on a remote mail server. Most email applications also display HTML (HyperText Markup Language) formatted emails that display objects, such as pictures and hyperlinks. The features of advanced email applications include the ability of importing address books/contact lists, configuration information, and emails from other email applications.

Linux supports the following types of email applications:

- Graphical email clients, such as Thunderbird, Evolution, and Claws Mail.
- Text mode email clients, such as Mutt and mail.
- All web browser-based clients, such as Gmail, Yahoo Mail, and Office 365.

### Other Internet Applications

Linux systems provide many other applications for performing Internet-related tasks. These include:

| Application | Use                                                                                      |
|-------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

### Office Applications

Most day-to-day computer systems have productivity applications (sometimes called office suites) available or installed. Each suite is a collection of closely coupled programs used to create and edit different kinds of files such as:

- Text (articles, books, reports, etc.)
- Spreadsheets
- Presentations
- Graphical objects.

Most Linux distributions offer [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/), an open source office suite that started in 2010 and has evolved from OpenOffice. While other office suites are available, LibreOffice is the most mature, widely used and intensely developed.

In addition, Linux users have full access to Internet-based office suites such as Google Docs and Microsoft Office 365.

### LibreOffice Components

The component applications included in LibreOffice are:

- Writer: Word Processing
- Calc: Spreadsheets
- Impress: Presentations
- Draw: Create and edit graphics and diagrams.

The LibreOffice applications can read and write non-native document formats, such as those used by Microsoft Office. Usually, fidelity is maintained quite well, but complicated documents might have some imperfect conversions.

### Development Applications

Linux distributions come with a complete set of applications and tools that are needed by those developing or maintaining both user applications and the kernel itself.

These tools are tightly integrated and include:

- Advanced editors customized for programmers' needs, such as vi and emacs.
- Compilers (such as gcc and clang for programs in C and C++) for every computer language that has ever existed, including very popular new ones such as Golang and Rust.
- Debuggers such as gdb and various graphical front ends to it and many other debugging tools (such as Valgrind).
- Performance measuring and monitoring programs, some with easy to use graphical interfaces, others more arcane and meant to be used only by serious experienced development engineers.
- Source and Revision control systems, such as [git](https://git-scm.com/) (and associated interfaces to it, including [GitHub](https://github.com/) and [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab)) and older systems, such as [Apache Subversion](https://subversion.apache.org/).
- Complete Integrated Development Environments (IDE's) such as Eclipse and Visual Studio Code that put all these tools together.

On other operating systems, these tools have to be obtained and installed separately, often at a high cost, while on Linux they are all available at no cost, either through standard package installation systems or direct downloading from the responsible maintainers and hosts.

| Rhythmbox   | Supports various digital music sources, including streaming Internet audio and podcasts. Allows searching in the library and supports smart playlists with automatic updates based on specified criteria. |

Of course, Linux systems can also connect with commercial online music streaming services, such as Pandora and Spotify through web browsers.

### GIMP (GNU Image Manipulation Program)

Graphic editors allow you to create, edit, view, and organize images of various formats, like Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG or JPG), Portable Network Graphics (PNG), Graphics Interchange Format (GIF), and Tagged Image File Format (TIFF).

The GNU Image Manipulation Program (GIMP) is a feature-rich image retouching and editing tool similar to Adobe Photoshop and is available on all Linux distributions. Some features of the GIMP are:

- It can handle any image file format.
- It has many special purpose plugins and filters.
- It provides extensive information about the image, such as layers, channels, and histograms.

### Examine Installed Applications on Your System

Using the **gnome-software** application, we can examine the list of installed applications on your system.

The **gnome-software** application should be available on any recent distribution.  Exactly where it is in the menus might vary, but you should be able to find it at **Applications > System Tools > Software**. You can also launch it by typing gnome-software on a terminal window or hitting **Alt-F2** and typing it.

Once you have the GUI open, you can click on Installed to see the list, which is probably not complete and will vary according to distribution and what you have installed.

Most distributions have other graphical applications that show the full list of installed (and available) packages organized into categories, many of which (but not most)  are applications.  On Debian-based systems such as Ubuntu, you can run **synaptic**. On OpenSuse, you can run **Yast**, etc.
