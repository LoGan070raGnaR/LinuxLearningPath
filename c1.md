# Chapter 1: The Linux Foundation

## Requirements

### Software Requirements

To fully engage with the content presented, it is essential to have a Linux distribution installed. If the term "distribution" is unfamiliar, it will become clearer as you progress through the material.

While there are numerous Linux distributions available, here we are primarily focuses on three major distribution families. Within each family, specific distributions are utilized for illustrations, examples, and exercises. It's important to note that this selection does not imply endorsement; rather, these distributions were chosen for their widespread usage and representativeness within their respective families.

The families and their representative distributions include:

1. Red Hat Family Systems (e.g., CentOS and Fedora)
2. SUSE Family Systems (e.g., openSUSE)
3. Debian Family Systems (e.g., Ubuntu and Linux Mint)

### Focus on Three Major Linux Distribution Families

In the next chapter, you will learn about the components that make up a Linux distribution.

For now, what you need to know is that this course focuses on the three major Linux distribution families that currently exist. However, as long as there are talented contributors, the families of distributions and the distributions within these families will continue to change and grow. People see a need, and develop special configurations and utilities to respond to that need. Sometimes that effort creates a whole new distribution of Linux. Sometimes, that effort will leverage an existing distribution to expand the members of an existing family.

For a rather long list of available distributions, see [The LWN.net Linux Distribution List](https://lwn.net/Distributions/).

### The Red Hat Family

Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) heads the family that includes CentOS, CentOS Stream, Fedora and Oracle Linux.

Fedora has a close relationship with RHEL and contains significantly more software than Red Hat's enterprise version. One reason for this is that a diverse community is involved in building Fedora, with many contributors who do not work for Red Hat. Furthermore, it is used as a testing platform for future RHEL releases.

For CentOS Stream and CentOS there is no cost to the end user, and there is a longer release cycle than for Fedora (which releases a new version every six months or so).

The basic version of CentOS is also virtually identical to RHEL, the most popular Linux distribution in enterprise environments. However, CentOS 8 has no scheduled updates after 2021. The replacement is CentOS 8 Stream. The difference between the two versions is CentOS Stream gets updates **before** RHEL, while CentOS gets them **after**.

### Key Facts About the Red Hat Family

Some of the key facts about the Red Hat distribution family are:

- Fedora serves as an upstream testing platform for RHEL.
- CentOS is a close clone of RHEL; in fact, CentOS has been part of Red Hat since 2014.
- A heavily patched version 4.18 kernel is used in RHEL/CentOS 8 Stream, while version 5.14 is used in RHEL/CentOS 9 Stream.
- It supports multiple hardware platforms.
- It uses dnf, the RPM-based package manager (covered in detail later) to install, update, and remove packages in the system.
- RHEL is widely used by enterprises which host their own systems.

### The SUSE Family

The relationship between SUSE  (SUSE Linux Enterprise Server, or SLES) and openSUSE is similar to the one described between RHEL, CentOS, and Fedora.

### Key Facts About the SUSE Family

Some of the key facts about the SUSE family are listed below:

- SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES) is upstream for openSUSE.
- Kernel version 5.14 is used in openSUSE Leap 15.4.
- It uses the RPM-based zypper package manager (we cover it in detail later) to install, update, and remove packages in the system.
- It includes the YaST (Yet Another Setup Tool) application for system administration purposes.
- SLES is widely used in retail and many other sectors.

### The Debian Family

The Debian distribution is upstream for several other distributions, including Ubuntu. In turn, Ubuntu is upstream for Linux Mint and a number of other distributions. It is commonly used on both servers and desktop computers. Debian is a pure open source community project (not owned by any corporation) and has a strong focus on stability.

Debian provides by far the largest and most complete software repository to its users of any Linux distribution.

Ubuntu aims at providing a good compromise between long term stability and ease of use. Since Ubuntu gets most of its packages from Debian’s stable branch, it also has access to a very large software repository.

### Key Facts About the Debian Family

Some key facts about the Debian family are listed below:

- The Debian family is upstream for Ubuntu, and Ubuntu is upstream for Linux Mint and others.
- Kernel version 5.19 is used in Ubuntu 22.04 LTS.
- It uses the DPKG-based APT package manager (using apt, apt-get, apt-cache, etc., which we cover in detail later) to install, update, and remove packages in the system.
- Ubuntu has been widely used for cloud deployments.
- While Ubuntu is built on top of Debian and is GNOME-based under the hood, it differs visually from the interface on standard Debian, as well as other distributions.

## Chapter Summary

- There are three major distribution families within Linux: Red Hat, SUSE and Debian. Here, we will work with representative members of all of these families throughout.
